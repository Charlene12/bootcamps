    "This notebook contains a complete example how to use the API of a service provider to get information and process the information. This example touches upon tackling a lot of problems at the same time, but once you got your head around it, it can serve as a framework to address real world issues. The example is based upon a notebook published by Ahmed Besbes: http://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-mine-newsfeed-data-and-extract-interactive-insights-in-python.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we start this example using an API, this first step could also be replaced by web-scraping to get data. We prefer the API route, because web-scraping is a somewhat cumbersome and brittle undertaking."
