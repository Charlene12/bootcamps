    "The first line is a comment line that makes the script usuable on various platforms.\n",
    "On the second line we import the sys (short for system) library, so that we in the next two lines can assign the first two arguments after the program name, when we run the file, to the variables \"input_file\" and \"output_file\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, with line 7, we open the file for reading ('r') from the commandline referred to by the variable \"input_file\" as a file object referred to as \"filereader\". In the next line we open a file for writing ('w') as a file object filewriter. Remember that list indexing in Python starts with 0. So argv[0] always refers to the script that one runs, argv[1] is the next argument on the commandline (the input_file) and argv[2] refers to the output_file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 9 uses the file_object's readline method to read in the first line of the input file as a string and assigns it to a variable named \"header\". So \"header\" now contains the first line of the input file \"food,amount,calories\". With line 10 we strip all whitespace from the string and line 11 splits the content of header on the  \",\" into a list of strings: ['food', 'amount', 'calories'] referred to by the variable \"header_list\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we do two things: Line 12 prints the content of \"header_list\" to standard output (the terminal when running the program) and line 13 writes the contents of \"header list\" to the filewriter object but it does the opposite of the split method: first of all it maps the \"str\" function over all elements of the \"header_list\", then it joins these elements with a ',' and adds a newline at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what it does is: ['food', 'amount', 'calories'] => 'food,amount,calories' and hands it over to filewriter. The rest of the input file is going through the same motion, but we use a for loop here to process all remaining lines of the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we did write a little \"roundtripper\" that touched all elements of the csv file (input), writing intermediate results to screen, and writing the end result to file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this might seem like a lot of work for doing \"nothing\", but it served a special purpose here: Showing how to process a csv file *not* using any libraries. But what is more, we could have done all sorts of useful stuff before writing the contents of the input file back to the output file."
