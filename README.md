Python bootcamps (EUR)
===

This Git repository contains the notebooks to be used for the Python
bootcamps at the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

Background
===

  - We want to introduce programming, using Python, to PhD students.
  - We want to establish an EUR Python community in order to be able
    to share knowledge and to provide a distributed form of support
    for members of the community.
  - Use a public repository to store the contents of the course.
  
Instruments used
===

- Anaconda Python distribution (Python 3.5)
- Jupyter Notebooks

Goals
===

- Understand that, in an academic context, it is important to be able
  to read, use and re-use code.
- Modular, comprehensible, re-usable and testable all come together.
- Solving problems with the computer can be fun; working together on
  solving these problems doubles the fun.
