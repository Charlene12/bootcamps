### Intro

One of the trickiest problems surrounding the bootcamps is the problem
that you need to get a lot of things going at the same time in order
to get to solving interesting, non-trivial, programming problems in
Python: Syntacs and semantics of the language itself, Jupyter
notebooks, CLI, REPL, and perhaps some more: Programming editor,
version control, etc.

I got the impression that the first half of the first day of the April
2017 BC, mainly dedicated to the syntax of the language, asked too
much of the participants. Quizes and 

Recently I came across the JUMP Math program developed by John
Mighton. The JUMP didatics contain interesting principles that we can
use to structure the (contents of) BC's.

### JUMP Math principles

The main principle of JUMP Math is "guided discovery" or "micro
inquiry": Teaching "big ideas" through a series of small steps.

The main didatic vehicles to achieve this are:

  - feedback (REPL and teacher)
  - worked examples
  - scaffolding
  - elicitated explanations (drawing out the answer/solution)
  
Scaffolding. We should scaffold the teaching materials: Breaking learning into
chunks and providing relevant examples and practice to help students
to tackle each chunk.

Logical progression. One chunk naturally leads to the next.

### Contents of a JUMP lesson

A JUMP lesson consists of:

  - a series of questions;
  - a series of exercises;
  - a series of challenges:
  
    - hard bonus questions;
	- exercises that consist of finding and correcting mistakes.
