    "So what do we know already? Most of you will probably have seen the movie by James Cameron (starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, 1997) which is one of several movies made with the disaster as subject. So you will be aware of the following:\n",
    "![The Movie](iu.jpeg)\n",
    "- the disaster took place during the night of April 14th, 1912 when the ship hit an iceberg on her maiden voyage out of Southampton (UK) to New York (US) via Cherbourg (FR) and Queenstown (IRE);\n",
    "- the loss of lives was 1501 out of a total of 2207 passengers and crew;\n",
    "- there was a shortage of lifeboats and some of the lifeboats were set afloat whilst not fully occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways of looking at the disaster. Apart from the movie he directed, James Cameron also made a computer generated simulation of the actual sinking of the ship, based upon the distribution of the debris:\n",

So, we are cheating big time here: Out there in the wild, working as a data scientist, you will have to accumulate the data yourself, often relying on various sources, which means a lot cleaning and \"harmonizing\". These preparations will usually take a lot of time, estimations vary but usually it is thought that 60-80% of the work with data is spend on acquiring data and preparing the data to be used for analysis.\n",
