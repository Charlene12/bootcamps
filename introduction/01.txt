We start our exploration of the Python language with a simple number
guessing game.

Underneath you will find elements of the Python code in alphabetical
order. Read them carefully and explain in your own words what you
think the Python code fragment accomplishes. Write it behind the code
fragments.

Hint: You can use the Python help function form the so-called Python
REPL, like so: ?int(). When in doubt, try things out in the REPL.

else:
g = input("Guess the number: ")
guess = int(g)
if guess == 5:
print("Game over!")
print("Welcome!")
print("You lose:-(")
print("You win!")
